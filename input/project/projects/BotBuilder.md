BotBuilder (Pronounced "bot-buh-builder") is a somewhat arcane "city builder" game where the player must produce a golden badge without running out of resources.

Designed for the 4th Battle of the Bits game jam.  The theme was to use the sprite sheet for battle of the bits (all icons on the site, including format badges, buttons, etc.), and produce a game that runs in HTML5 over 2 weeks.  BotBuilder received 6th place overall.

BotBuilder is built on HaxeFlixel, a very lightweight framework that is well suited to both the web environment as well as 2D games.  This was my first attempt at both Haxe, the language, and Flixel, the framework, which amounted to a moderate success.  I chose HaxeFlixel as the framework of choice because exports were well under the strict limit of ~20 MBs (final export was 4 MB, with 9 kB HTML manual).

Leaning into Battle of the Bit's quirky and often arcane nature, I designed the interface to allow full use of the keyboard.  And only the keyboard.  A manual is absolutely required to play the game.  Good luck!
