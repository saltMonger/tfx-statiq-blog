Crab Bungalow was developed for Brackeys 2021.1 jam, a seven day game jam with the theme "Stronger Together."  The team decided to develop a Pikmin styled game where the player gathers hordes of crabs and commands them to solve various puzzles.

I wrote audio code to support the unfolding narrative of the game, including audio zones to handle advancement of the soundtrack, as well as multiple background music zones.

This was the first game jam that the team had worked on to extend after the jam deadline, with a second version seeing a completely redesigned island, dialogue system, and tutorial.  Additional work was done to rewrite the core crab AI, as well as produce an interactable system which is the basis for our current game jam library.
