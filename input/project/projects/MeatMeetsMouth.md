Meat Meets Mouth is a bizarre 2D physics game for Windows computers.

TEAM: 
tfx - Code, Music
HomingDevice - Code, Art

Designed and built during a friendly 7 hour game jam where a group of friends and I were split into 3 random teams.  The theme for the jam was "Limited Palette" and a website was used to generate a 4 color palette to work with.

We chose Game Maker (GM Studio 1.4) as a development platform as iteration is relatively quick, our team had licenses, and both of us were comfortable with Game Maker Language.  Both of us were able to contribute code and switch between tasks as necessary (e.g., produce music while the menu/score system was created, or create chicken nugget sprites while physics joints were being configured).

Music was written as quickly as possible, using one take for each track (~10 minutes total time spent) - some of my highest quality work :)
