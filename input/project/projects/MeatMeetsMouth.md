# 7 Hour Game Jam
Meat Meets Mouth is a bizarre 2D physics game that was designed, built, and tested in just 7 hours.  The game is available via an executable on itch.io, where it was submitted to a 7 hour long game jam where it placed 1st out of 3 games.  Code and music by myself, with additional code and all graphics by HomingDevice.
