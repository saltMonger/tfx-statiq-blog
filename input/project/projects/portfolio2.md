Redesigned portfolio.

My redesigned portfolio built from the ground up in Statiq.Web (with a little help from [Bradley Wells blog template](https://github.com/bradwellsb/statiq-blog-boilerplate)).  The website is statically served HTML, designed with razor components, and generated from markdown files.  The website is rebuilt and deployed by a github action.  A small node.js/express backend handles collecting information from the Contact Me form and sends emails to my personal inbox.

Source code for my website can be found on my github.  Additionally, I have a blog post series starting [here](https://tfx.seawavescollective.net/blog/2021/news/firstpost.html) covering my process of learning Statiq.Web, and overcoming a number of challenges.
