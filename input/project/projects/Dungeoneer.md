Dungeoneer was designed for the 8th Bored Pixels Jam, a 7 day game jam with the theme "You are not the hero."  Our team decided early on that we wanted an experience outside of an anti hero or big bad - we wanted something that would take a look at the mundane.  Thus, the player takes on the role of a dungeon janitor, resetting the many rooms and calming creatures to ready the dungeon for the next hero.  

This jam saw further refinement of our task system, and a new piece of library technology: the GameManager.  This allowed us to employ a common menu to each scene which would later be expanded to enable options, a help screen, and credits.  The GameManager also allowed progressive level loading, and tied into the TaskManager system to allow scoring.

I wrote the music for this game on my Yamaha TG100, a small, 1990's desktop ROMpler unit, and contributed a large portion of the sound design and foley work.
