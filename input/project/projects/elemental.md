Created for the DayKnights30 Fall 2022 Game Jam.  This game uses polycam 3d scans of buildings and locations in Detroit, Michigan, which have been processed to create an impossible/dream-like game world.

Elemental is a multimedia collectathon/platformer that takes place in the world of ELEMENTAL, a concept album by MURK.  Exploring the game and discovering secrets unlocks playable music videos and additional outtake clips from the saga.

Some technology developed for this game includes persistent saves and unlockable systems, narrative sequences, and a reusable UI component system for menus.
