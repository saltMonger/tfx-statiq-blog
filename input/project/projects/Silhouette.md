Silhouette was designed for the 3 day Dev Atlas #2 jam, with heavy emphasis on playing with light sources.  The game uses home spun technology which transforms projected shadows into colliders in real time.  This enables creative environment and level design, where the stage moves and hazards evolve as the player moves their camera.
