Say that one time fast.  Just once.

AYCE is:
- tfx: Code
- pigu: Code, Art
- DevEd: Code, Art, Outro Music
- 25_8_pu2k: Art
- Zlew: Main Demo Music

This was a group effort between myself and my friends from the AYCE (All You Can Execute) demo group. This represents a month worth of work from a team of five members, each with a different skill set (programming, music, and graphics) coming together to create a limit pushing product. 

Notable effects include the high-color image (showing more than the 16 colors "possible" on tic80), and the fractal zoomer. I was personally responsible for sewing together all sections of the demo, creating several transitions, the text scroller, and plasma cubes (with a little help from a friend).
