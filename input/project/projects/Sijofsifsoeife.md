## tic80 demo

This was a group effort between myself and my friends from the AYCE (All You Can Execute) demo group. This represents a month worth of work from a team of five members, each with a different skill set (programming, music, and graphics) coming together to create a limit pushing product. Notable effects are the high-color image (showing more than the 16 colors "possible" on tic80), and the fractal zoomer. Personally responsible for sewing together all sections of the demo, creating several transitions, the text scroller, and plasma cubes (with a little help from a friend).
