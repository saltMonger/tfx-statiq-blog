Hatch Patch is a WebAssembly-based tool for suggesting patch for synthesizers (or other instruments!).
  
  
TEAM:

- tfx: Code

Created for The Tool Jam 3.  This is a web utility design to create prompts for sound design.  Specifically, the interface is designed for music synthesizers, but the ideas and recommendations can be applied to other instruments.

Development for HatchPatch is ongoing, with the following planned features:
- Song Mode
- Patch Gauntlet Mode
- Patch Mutator Mode

The development log and updates are available in the [devlog section](/blog/categories/devlog), and additionally mirrored on [Itch.io](https://saltmonger.itch.io/hatch-patch/devlog).
