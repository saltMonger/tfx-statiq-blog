Created for the JuiceJam II Game Jam.  

Slime Ball is a pinball game made in the spirit of _Sonic Spinball_.  The game takes place across multiple different pinball boards that are unlocked by increasing your score.  The center board features a mechanic where pinballs are sacrificed to fill a vat, and the vat can be dumped to deplete the king slime.  

New technology for this game includes level design tools that use splines to create procedural layouts of pickups, bouncers, and light-up lanes.

Additionally, the soundtrack contains some nods to both _Sonic Spinball_ and _Sonic 3D Blast_.
