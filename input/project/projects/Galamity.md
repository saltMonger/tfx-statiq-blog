### tic80 demo

Compofiller Compound is the miracle cream that will solve all your problems! This is a tic80 demo that was written in a week, in place of a much larger demo that was not ready for entry into a competition. This particular entry was finished in the hardware room of Xenium 2019 in Katowice, Poland, just 10 minutes before deadline. It placed 2nd out of 6 entries in the Wild Compo, which includes all entries that don't fit another competition (rendered animations, films and videos, or people dancing live). This demo is available on pouet, where it can be downloaded as the original party archive which includes the tools necessary to run it.
