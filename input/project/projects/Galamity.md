Galamity was designed for Shacknews Jam V: The Final Frontier.  The jam's theme was to reimagine a classic arcade game - we chose to revisit the classic _Galaga_, in the style of an on-rails shooter like _Star Fox_.  The jam submission time was a full month, but we entered halfway through and finished our game in two weeks.

This was the first game where I was interested in building tooling for level designers.  Weapons could be constructed using premade emitter prefabs and patterns, enemies could be constructed to use these designed weapons, and enemy spawners could be configured to spawn enemies on paths.  This allowed our designer, Metric, to build levels and enemies without touching a single line of code.

Additonally, this was our first WebGL export, and taught us a lot about the constraints of the platform.  For the smoothest experience, the Windows build is recommended.
