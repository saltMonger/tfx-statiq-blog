### Atari 800 XL demo

That's skank as in the dance move!  Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up!  No Bank Skank was a demo written for the Atari 800 XL platform, a home computer released in 1983.  This particular demo was designed to be a 64kb executable - all graphics, music, and code are packed into 64 kilobytes by Pigu's awesome compression routine.  This was my first real entry into the demoscene, and while my screen (the strange blob of yellow-ish creatures in the second effect) didn't quite come out correctly, it humbled me thinking about how much time I put into writing for such a difficult system, and what else I could learn.  In addition to that single screen, I also assisted in writing some code for the Twister part, as well as some general algorithm design for the Metaballs section.  This was a team effort - pigu, yuki, and I were responsible for code, with pigu and doctor contributing graphics, and zlew writing scroller text and music.  Additional fox supplied a custom, small music replayer routine and provided help with the system in general.  This runs on real hardware!  But, in case you don't have an old Atari 800 XL lying around, a capture has been uploaded to youtube.
