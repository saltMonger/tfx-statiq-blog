Iron Drought was developed for the second Mech Jam game jam.  Adhering to the rules of "make a game about mechs," the team created a game in the style of _Armored Core_ and _Mech Warrior_.  The game was awarded first place for Fun Factor, and scored highly in Audio and Overall.

I contributed a 5 tracks for this game, with additional guitar tracks from Matt J Hart.  The music was produced in ~10 days.
