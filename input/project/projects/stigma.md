Soulful Atari Chiptune.

This was written for the Atari-only Battle of the Bits compo, "Atari Trilogy."  It received 3rd place overall.

The .SND runs on a real Atari ST, and the render available for download on Battle of the Bits is rendered courtesy of YQN.  STigma was the sum of my emotions in the last few moments of 2018.
