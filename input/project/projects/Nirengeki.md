Nirengeki was developed for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam, an absolutely massive, 2 day long game jam.  The theme was "Joined Together."  We developed a top down space shooter where the player controls both the main ship, responsible for shooting enemies, and a drone that collects pickups to aid the ship.

This jam was a lot of fun to work on with the feedback loop between design, development, and polish being super quick.  Despite our ongoing effort to increase the amount of time between code freeze and submission deadline, this game was submitted less than 30 minutes from deadline.

I wrote the music for this game on using a mixture of SynthMaster One and SythMaster 2.9, as well as the KORG M1 Plugin.
