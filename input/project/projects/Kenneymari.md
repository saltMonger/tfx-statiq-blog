Kenneymari was designed for the 2022 Kenney jam. All visual assets originated or were derived from Kenney art packs, as per jam requirements.  

Kenneymari received 15th place out of 299 entries, with 10th place in the Theme category.

The game uses a newer incarnation of Recapture's internal sound library which supports zone and action based adaptive music.  Additional layers of sound are added at certain character controller speed breakpoints, and the different regions of the game environment have their own themes and variations.
