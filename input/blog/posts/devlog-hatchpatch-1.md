This comes as a quick post-jam update to satisfy some suggestions following the jam.

The following features have been added:

### In-line Settings Editing

Lists in the Settings screen now support add/edit/delete of list items.  Press the EDIT button to begin editing a list, and then SAVE to commit the changes (or cancel to discard them!)
Bulk-update via text file is still supported to load large amounts of settings (looking at you Plugin Boutique newsletter subscribers).  Text-file import will overwrite any existing list items.
A user list search bar has been added to help find and edit (or delete) entries in large lists.

### Home Screen Changes 

Added search/filtering options for patches list.  Search by patch name (or file name), and filter by patch type.
Removed top-3 patch card view on the home page to reduce duplication of data.  This might reappear later if patches become shareable/servable from some larger repository.
Additional changes include a bit of restructuring and some improved responsiveness on the Settings page.

Upcoming planned features include a Gauntlet and Song mode for more long form/game-like creation.  Additionally, I'll release a post with notes on getting a Blazor Web Assembly application to play nicely on Itch!

Suggestions for future features/integrations/bug fixes are always welcome!
