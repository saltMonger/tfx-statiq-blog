# First Refresh

My shit is whack
and I'm coming up with this blog
stream of consciouness
edit this shit later
okay here we go

gotta revitalize my website because it's been like 2 years since I've given half a fuck

### Thoughts for moving away:
1. Crusty: the project is no longer maintained
2. Requires running server component: for what is a bunch of static pages that I don't update particularly often... this is pretty overkill
3. Admin interface is horribly broken: enough that the mere thought of creating a new page gives me heartburn.  I want to give this site files that I generate outside in the comfort of some other text editor, and not a text area that's 3 px wide because it's nested under 400 components.


### FIRST STEPS:
reverse engineer the old system: it was enduro.js, which was abandoned 
what I want: something that can generate a static site - I don't really have data driven anything that I need. MAYBE something that will talk to a server backend to send me mail -this might be dangerous.

I'd be interested in something F# (Fornax, but very hard), or Handlebars.
Additionally, I'd have some interest in possibly working with a C# razor/blazor => not a sight you have to download... but maybe that would be cool (maybe see how small they can get?)  In that case, I do like MudBlazor, and I can probably figure out how to make my own framework.

Going the razor route, since I'm currenlty immersing myself in blazor projects and generally enjoy writing things in... relatively C#ish fashion, there is an admittedly old project called *Graze*.  

#### Side Note
It's a very fine line between chosing new technology to grow my brain with and choosing technology that I can work immediately.  I'd certainly like to challenge myself, but choosing something that has such a steep learning curve as Fornax feels dangerous.

### WHAT ELSE?
Well... the styling could maybe use a little bit of a refresh.  I'm interested in what I could possibly do with extending/mutilating Bootstrap, Material, or Bulma (or something else like that).  For the previous site I've really only used *skeleton.css* for the grid component, and just did styling for all of my containers myself.  This will take a bit of meditation.
 
### HOW IT FEELS:
