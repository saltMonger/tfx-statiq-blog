As is traditional with the vast majority of blog writing software developers, after freshly minting my new blog framework I have abandoned it.

Life has been fast and things are changing so it's time to return to and dust things off! I have had a few drafted blog posts that have went in and out of editing a few time, so I may post this back again when they're cleaned up (and recovered, whoops).  Additionally, I'll be using this website to mirror devlogs for a few tools I have planned.

Here are some quick patch notes for the website:
- Add left and right gallery transport controls for projects
- 7 new project entries!
	- [Hansel](/project/hansel.html)
	- [Layover](/project/layover.html)
	- [Kenneymari](/project/kenneymari.html)
	- [ELEMENTAL](/project/elemental.html)
	- [SlimeBall](/project/slimeball.html)
	- [Bullet Hell 2023](/project/bullethell2023.html)
	- [Hatch Patch](/project/hatchpatch.html)

Some planned future articles:
- How to host Blazor web-apps on Itch.io
- RadioShack ColorComputer 1 cleanup and coding
- Help I impulse bought a Pi Pico Explorer kit at Microcenter and now I have to do something with it
- Thoughts and feelings on learning DSP, software synthesis, and `zig` (simultaneously)
